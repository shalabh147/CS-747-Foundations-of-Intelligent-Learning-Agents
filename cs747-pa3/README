Commandline arguments taken by the script :
--algo : the algorithm to run, one of ’sarsa’, ’expected_sarsa’ and ’q-learning’.
--actions : Number of actions that can be taken : 4 normally, 8 when kings moves.
--rows : 10
--columns : 7
--steps : maximum number of time steps to be run.
--allthree : set to 1 when want a plot comparison of all three algorithms. Need to set actions = 4 and stochasticity = 0. set to 0 otherwise.
--stochasticity : set to 1 when want stochasticity. Need to set algo = sarsa and actions = 8 in thiscase. set to 0 otherwise. Example run given below.

Example run:
$ python agents.py --algo sarsa --actions 4 --rows 10 --columns 7 --steps 8000 --allthree 0 --stochastic 0

To plot variations between the Non stochastic 4 moves, stochastic 8 moves and non stochastic 8 moves, you will need to uncomment the commented portion at the end of agents.py.

If need to change wind vector, change in environment.py
If need to change rows and columns, give it as argument to agents.py and change in environment.py but remember to change start and end state also in both files.
